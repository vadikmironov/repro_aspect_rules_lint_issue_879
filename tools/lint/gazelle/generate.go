// GenerateRules dispatches to per-language generators based on which
// language segments are present in this scaffold. Each per-language
// hook inspects args.File.Rules for source rules whose kind matches
// that linter's allowlist; per-target opt-out via tags = ["no-lint"]
// is honoured by every generator (see hasSkipTag in lang.go).
// Per-package opt-out via the # gazelle:lint_ignore directive is
// honoured here, suppressing generation entirely for that package.
//
// Per-package freeze via the # gazelle:lint_ignore_keep directive is
// honoured first: such packages return an empty result with no Gen and
// no Empty, so gazelle neither adds nor removes lint_test rules and the
// hand-written (e.g. section-gated) rules are left untouched.
//
// After dispatch, any pre-existing rule of an owned kind that is not
// in the generated set is added to Empty so gazelle deletes it. This
// is what gives lint_ignore and no-lint their "remove on next run"
// behaviour: returning Gen with fewer rules is not enough — gazelle
// preserves owned rules unless explicitly told to delete them.
//
// Under -lint_remove (p.removeAll) generation is suppressed in every
// package, so computeEmpty reaps all owned rules repo-wide — the whole-
// feature teardown the bootstrap tool runs when lint is dropped. Frozen
// (lint_ignore_keep) packages are still left untouched, since their
// hand-gated rules ship via section markers, not gazelle.
